# Cathay-Hackathon
Training a Machine Leaning Model to get accurate Carbon Emissions per passenger per flight

## Pipeline Steps
Let's see: <br>
    1. Look into Cathay's api and see if the data is relevant <br> 
    2. Look Online how calculator's work <br> 
    3. Look at the online flight data available <br> 
    4. Clean and combine useful data <br> 
    5. Train model <br> 
    6. Check Accuracy with test data <br> 
    7. Compare with traditional calculator formula <br> 
    8. Then present this data <br>  
    
Main Blockers - Getting actual flight data might be difficult, let's see....
