# Cathay-Hackathon
Training a Machine Leaning Model to get accurate Carbon Emissions per passenger per flight

## Pipeline Steps
Let's see:
    1. Look into Cathay's api and see if the data is relevant 
    2. Look Online how calculator's work 
    3. Look at the online flight data available 
    4. Clean and combine useful data 
    5. Train model
    6. Check Accuracy with test data
    7. Compare with traditional calculator formula 
    8. Then present this data 
    
Main Blockers - Getting actual flight data might be difficult, let's see....
